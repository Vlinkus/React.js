Practising **React.JS** Adding simple components.\
Current status:
  ### Routing 
    Completed using HashRouter, because had an issue whith rounting when used BrowserRounting 
    after deployed in gitHub. GitHub Pages doesn't natively support single page apps. 
    When there is a fresh page load for a url like React_js/car1, where /car1 is a frontend route,
    the GitHub Pages server returns 404 because it knows nothing of /car1. That was solved using HashRouter.
  ### Carousel
   Simple carousel example as slide one by one.
